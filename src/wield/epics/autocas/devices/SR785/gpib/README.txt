# This Folder contains scripts based on the netGPIB 
# package originally developed at the 40m lab
# The HP4195A and AG4395A scripts are based
# on an older version of the netGPIB package
# and contain explicit calls to gpibplot.py and
# termstatus.py.  The SR785 scripts have these features
# integrated into the functions themselves.  
# Please do not modify these scripts.  Save your own
# copies somewhere else if you wish to tweak them. 
# Data should be saved somewhere else as well
# such as in the /ligo/h1sqz/data/ directory.
