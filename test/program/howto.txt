Main program run test:

python test_program.py -c config.toml run

then while that is going, run medm

medm -x test_program.adl


Cool, it starts up epics variables. Programatically updates them and you can see them in medm.


You can look at what is inside of config.toml and inside the test_program.py to figure out how to extend the code and make your own variables
